# pennyops
Penny Ops was an iOS app written in Apple's Swift language and built using Apple's Xcode IDE.  The app would gather data of cheap options being traded that day and presented them on a nice mobile UI.  It also offered several different filter options for the user to create their own queries. 

Traffic was large at first.  But as traffic died down, I saw no further use to keeping the app running and I shut down the main server.  The app is now off the App Store with no plans to return.
